      "**Background on Epilepsy**  \n",
      "- Epilepsy is a neurological condition in which a person experiences recurrent seizures.  \n",
      "- About 60 % of people with epilepsy have focal seizures, which originate in one cerebral hemisphere.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Seizure Phase Characteristics**  \n",
      "- **Ictal phase** – This is the period from the beginning of the seizure (including an aura, if present) to its end. It is the stage most people recognize as a seizure.  \n",
      "- During the ictal phase, a person may display a variety of symptoms that differ between individuals. Typical manifestations can include repetitive small or large movements, unusual sensations, or emotional changes.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Seizure Type Characteristics**  \n",
      "- **Focal seizures** start in a localized area of one side of the brain.  \n",
      "- Awareness may be **preserved** (the person can remember the event and respond to the environment) or **impaired** (the person’s consciousness is affected).  \n",
      "- An aura, when it occurs, is considered a focal aware seizure (formerly called a simple partial seizure) and may remain localized or spread, potentially evolving into a focal‑to‑bilateral seizure within seconds to minutes.  \n",
      "- Most focal seizures are brief, lasting from a few seconds up to a few minutes.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Diagnostic Considerations**  \n",
      "- Clinical description of the seizure (onset, awareness, motor or sensory phenomena, duration) is essential for classifying the event as focal.  \n",
      "- Observation of an aura and its evolution can help differentiate a focal aware seizure from a focal seizure that progresses to bilateral involvement.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**General Management & Next Steps**  \n",
      "- **Safety first:** Remain calm, reassure the individual, and stay with them to protect against injury during the ictal event.  \n",
      "- **When to seek emergency care:** Most focal seizures resolve without medical intervention, but an ambulance should be called if the seizure is prolonged, if the person does not regain baseline awareness promptly, or if there are concerns for injury or other complications.  \n",
      "- **Follow‑up evaluation:** After a witnessed focal seizure, arranging a clinical review with a neurologist or epilepsy specialist is advisable to discuss further assessment and individualized care planning.  \n",
